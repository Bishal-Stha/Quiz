# Quiz Application üéì

This is an Android-based quiz app that asks a series of questions and provides feedback based on user responses. Users can answer multiple-choice questions and see the correct or incorrect status immediately after selecting an answer. The app supports navigation between questions and displays a final screen after completing the quiz.

## Features üöÄ
- **Multiple-choice questions**: The app presents a list of questions, each with four answer options.
- **Immediate feedback**: Users get instant feedback on whether their selected answer is correct or not.
- **Final score screen**: Upon completion, the app displays a congratulatory message and the total score.
- **Edge-to-edge UI**: The app is designed to support modern Android edge-to-edge layouts.
- **Smooth navigation**: Users can navigate through questions using a "Next" button.
  
## Application Structure üèóÔ∏è

The application consists of two main screens:
1. **Main Quiz Screen**: Displays questions and answer options, and tracks user progress.
2. **Final Screen**: Shown after the user completes all the questions, it congratulates the user on finishing the quiz.

### 1. MainActivity (`MainActivity.kt`)
- Handles displaying questions, tracking user responses, and navigating to the next question.
- Displays instant feedback if the user's answer is correct or incorrect.
- At the end of the quiz, it transitions to the final screen.

### 2. Final Screen (`finalScreen.kt`)
- Displays a congratulatory message upon completion of the quiz.
- UI is simple, featuring a large image and congratulatory text.

### 3. Data Class (`Question.kt`)
- Defines the `Question` model, which contains the following fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the question.
  - `question`: The quiz question.
  - `option1`, `option2`, `option3`, `option4`: Answer choices.
  - `answer`: The correct answer to the question.

## Layout Design üñºÔ∏è

### `activity_main.xml`
- The main layout includes:
  - **CardView** for displaying the question and answer options.
  - **RadioGroup** for presenting multiple-choice answers.
  - **TextView** for feedback on whether the answer is correct or incorrect.
  - **ImageButton** for navigating to the next question.
  
### `activity_final_screen.xml`
